                            I'm Felix, I'm a Cyber security analyst and a nna engineer with a passion for teaching. I'm the lead instructor at the Cyberhive, London's leading Programming Bootcamp. I've helped hundreds of thousands of students learn to code and change their lives by becoming a developer. I've been invited by companies such as Twitter, Facebook and Google to teach their employees.
                            I always tell my students to continue striving to improve themselves and their work. I seek out feedback and are open to constructive criticism as a means of self-improvement always striving to improve themselves and their work. 
                            I understands that the field of cyber security is constantly evolving, and is able to adapt to changes and new challenges as they arise. I maintain a flexible mindset and are open to new ideas and approaches.
                            Letâ€™s go on this journey together.
